      <p class="intro">
        I host services and build platform AI/ML features for distributed compute --
        building helm charts, configuring node pools, wiring up services, making
        the path from git push to production as short as possible.
        Infra has been luring me in my whole career. I started as an electrical engineer
        writing constraint optimization and math equations. Got introduced to ML,
        wrote few projects that actually made an impact. Moved to insurance.
        Through all of it, deployment was the thing that bugged me -- getting models and
        services actually running, reliably, at scale. That's the real software. That's
        what I love to work on.

      <h2>The 5x Engineer</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a 2x, maybe 3x engineer on a good day. The aspiration is 5x. But here's the thing --
        being a 1x engineer is itself a moving target. What counted as 1x two years ago
        is table stakes now. AI code tools rewrote the baseline. Life changes shift what
        you can give. The goal post moves.
      </p>
      <p>
        The multiplier isn't about raw code output. It's about range. I've written optimization
        solvers, ML models, data pipelines, SDKs, Terraform modules, and deployment systems.
        Every time I thought I was done learning a new layer, the layer below it turned out to
        be the interesting one. The math led to ML. ML led to pipelines. Pipelines led to
        deployment. Deployment led to infrastructure. Infra is where I landed.

      <h2>What I'm Building Now</h2>
      <p>
        At Autodesk, I'm building an AI/ML platform pushing for a unified control plane
        across all services -- centralization of the stack with self-service as the goal.
        I'm also an in-house tool builder and maintainer -- co-built an AI code review
        tool that's better than Copilot and maybe CodeRabbit, and adoption has been wild.
      </p>
      <ul class="work-list">
        <li>Developing and maintaining 5+ interconnected Terraform modules for infrastructure deployment</li>
        <li>EKS cluster setup, ArgoCD application deployments, promotion pipelines</li>
        <li>Deploying MCP servers in ECS containers</li>
        <li>Distributed training infrastructure -- data/tensor/pipeline parallelism, checkpointing...</li>
        <li>Monitoring, logging, debugging tooling and developer ergonomics</li>
        <li>GitHub webhook apps</li>
        <li>Performance bottleneck investigation across the full ML systems stack</li>

      <h2>The Startup Chapter</h2>
      <p>
        I co-founded slashML. The pitch: create AI applications in your private cloud. Data never
        leaves your premises. We got into Alchemist Accelerator (Class 37). We built things:
      </p>
      <ul class="work-list">
        <li>Co-launched an AI Data Scientist with secure code execution -- deployed to 200+ users</li>
        <li>Co-developed secure model hosting across multiple clouds -- 100+ Llama models deployed</li>
        <li>Co-built a tool to chat with GitHub codebases</li>
        <li>Co-built a full-stack AI deployment studio with GPU workspaces</li>
        <li>Co-developed a Python SDK unifying AWS, GCP, and Azure APIs</li>
        <li>Technical content reaching 5,000+ monthly readers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We interviewed 300+ ML engineers and 100+ AI managers to validate the market.
        We benchmarked and fine-tuned specialized LLMs. We built an agent system modeled
        after Magentic One. We did the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it didn't work out. I'm a failed startup founder. Tried B2B, tried dev tools.
        Nothing prepares you for this journey -- not the technical skills, not the market research,
        not the accelerator. The thing that's hard about startups is everything at once.
        I'd do it differently now, but I wouldn't trade the experience.
